Stratus is a desktop cross platform weather app. The app shows the weather of a specific place, and the weather over the following days.
The application makes use of the Darksky's API to get the weather data.

The app by default is using my current town Illescas, to use another place you have to edit the home.js file and change the latitude and logitude.


## Dev

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

```
$ npm start
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
